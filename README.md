# Otsu's Algorithm
An implementation of Otsu's method for automatic image thresholding in Python.

# Introduction
Otsu's method is a widely used technique for automatically determining an optimal threshold for image binarization. This repository contains a Python implementation of Otsu's Algorithm, allowing you to easily apply it to grayscale images.
