### Otsu's Algorithm for Image Thresholding
This repository demonstrates the implementation of Otsu's algorithm, a popular method for image thresholding. Otsu’s method calculates the optimal threshold by minimizing intra-class variance, which is particularly useful for separating foreground and background in grayscale images

Features
- Image Thresholding: Automatic calculation of optimal threshold value for image segmentation
- Otsu’s Algorithm: Implementation of the algorithm to binarize grayscale images
- Python Implementation: The algorithm is implemented in Python for ease of use
